# IS 310 Fall 2024
All of Alan's work in IS 310 during the Fall of 2024

This respository also includes the virtual environment (a.k.a. venv) I created if I wanted to continue my work on a new machine (like from my desktop or laptop)

Make sure the virtual environment is activated before running anything.

Run this command first:
```
IS310venv/Scripts/activate
```
