# NFL Teams Data Scraper

## Overview
I scraped data from the [American Football Fandom Wiki](https://americanfootball.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_NFL_Teams) to gather information about NFL teams, including their names, year founded, and team logos. The scraped data is saved into a CSV file, and the team logos are also saved locally. 

## Checking the NFL ToS
Before scraping, I checked out the site's terms of service and user policies to ensure I wasn't doing anything too naughty. The robots.txt file of the Fandom, found [here](https://americanfootball.fandom.com/robots.txt), indicates the rules and restrictions regarding web scraping and automated access to the site.

As far as I know, I'm not a bot, and I'm not trying to scrape any of the restricted pages, so I am all good to scrape to my heart's content.

## Why NFL Teams?
I chose to scrape data from the American Football Fandom Wiki because it contains information about all NFL teams, including the name, year founded, and image of their logo. This was the best fandom that containts this information surprisingly; I thought there might be a different football wiki that had more info on each team.

This could serve as a snapshot of what all 32 teams in the NFL look like right now. When any team can change their name, logo, cease to exist, or begin to exist, we can look back at this time and see how things have changed since. Knowing what the NFL teams were and looked like is useful as people in the future can look back and compare it to their teams in the future.

The data gathered from this will be just as effective at communicating what the original page did, even if the wiki were to go down and no longer be available. This is mainly because I saved all the images, so anyone in the future can view them.
